# Smart AC Proof of Concept

## Device Message Examples

### Boot-up message

Upon boot up and before s***REMOVED***ing sensor readings, the AC unit should make an HTTP
post to the device registration ***REMOVED***point `/api/devices/register` with the
following message:

```json
{
  "serial_number": "A123456",
  "firmware_version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### Boot-up message response

The registration ***REMOVED***point will respond with a JSON body containing the
`device_id` that the AC unit should s***REMOVED*** in sensor messages and the
current time.

```json
{
  "device_id": "2d85fd01-9766-4996-85a3-50876558d8a0",
  "current_time": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+0000"
}
```

### Sensor-reading messages

Once a sensor reading is made, the AC unit should make an HTTP POST to the
device readings ***REMOVED***point `/api/devices/readings`:

```json
{
  "device_id": "2d85fd01-9766-4996-85a3-50876558d8a0",
  "health_status": "needs_new_filter",
  "readings": ***REMOVED***
    {
      "sequence_number": 1,
      "recorded_at": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+0000",
      "sensor_values": {
        "temperature_c": 30.0,
        "humidity_%": 25.0,
        "carbon_monoxide_ppm": 0.01
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The server will respond with a 200 OK status code if the message is successfully
received.

## Questions

Q: Are the AC unit serial numbers guaranteed to be unique?

A: Yes

Q: How many AC units are deployed?

Q: Presumably the AC units speak HTTPS. What message protocol will the AC units speak? Binary protocol, XML, JSON or something else? Will different firmware versions have a different message protocol? For this POC, can I simply use a JSON protocol?

A: You can make them up, the idea would be that you are proposing how these would look like since the client hasnâ€™t been built yet and we have room for accommodating
